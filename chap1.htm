        <h1>Chapter 1: <strong>Suzie</strong></h1>
        <h2> Warning: It's related to games.</h2>
        <p>This story is a bit funny, it's about a little girl in the <strong>Game</strong> name's <strong>Play Together</strong>.</p>
        <p>Her nickname is <strong>Suzie</strong>(I don't know her real name). At the first time I meet her, I ask her to be my girlfriend, and she accept.</p>
        <p>One day, I and she was playing but someone walked to me and ask:"Is that your girlfriend?", I say yes and a few moments later, everything were difference.</p>
        <p>The person who asked me was my friend too, but older than me. Her name is <strong>Cút</strong>.</p>
        <p>My girlfriend look at me with an angry face, I don't what happened. I said to Cút is:"You have to ask me have a girlfriend yet before calculating it."</p>
        <p>"What is 'calculating it?'" said Cút. I can't think she's that stupid. I was speechless with shock, don't know what to say so I said thank you and went away.</p>
        <p>I still don't know what happened. Then Cút invite me to a party, and I went to that party. At that party I saw Suzie, Cút said to Suzie is:"That guy is here",</p>
        <p>and Suzie said:"Ignore him". No matter what I say, it's useless. I went out and walked around the town to relieved sadness.</p>
        <p>Then I sat on the beach and watched the sea. Cút came to me again and said:"See? Your girlfriend doesn't likes you anymore. Now, please be my boyfriend."</p>
        <p>I don't believe her, I send a massage to Suzie to ask what was happened and she replied to me:"She(Cút) said to me she is your girlfriend."</p>
        <p>Now I realized what was happened. I send a massage to my girlfriend and it says:"Cút lied to you, I'm not her boyfriend.", and she replied to me with a word "huh"</p>
        <p>I asked Cút:"You lied to my girlfriend, right?", "What?! Yes, I lied to your girlfriend. So what?" said Cút. And... I don't remember anything else after Cút said:"So what?"</p>
        <p> but Suzie was reconciled with me. I met her cousin, her name's <strong>Vy</strong> and older than me. I and Vy become friendly together. Do you know? Everything were difference again after few days,</p>
        <p>Vy said to me:"Your girlfriend said to me:"Please say to my boyfriend. I and him are not compatible with each other, break up with me."", and... I break up with her.</p>
        <p>That's all. Thank you for read my story.</p>
